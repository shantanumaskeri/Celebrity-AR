1. Facebook Unity SDK will upload media as a post. On clicking it will not load the media within Facebook, but rather re-direct the user to where the media has been stored on a server.
 
1. Twitter Unity SDK currently does not allow composing, tweeting of video content. Allowed media includes photos, text tweets.

2. Instagram Unity SDK is not as easily available as Facebook/Twitter, also not free of cost. Without R&D and testing, plugins accuracy is not guaranteed. Information for this process is scarce and far from consistent.

3. There may be problems with parts of the footage for e.g. the opaque parts of video become transparent or things like the green screen colour spilling onto your subject. Professional video editing have very complex chroma keying tools with features that you couldnâ€™t squeeze into a high performance shader. The footage used with this shader had to run through a video editing program to use spill suppression, clean up the green screen to a solid colour and fix up the edges of the subject of the footage.
